<ul>
  <li>Long Press on big data card results in swipe to right and visible two buttons (remind me later and dismiss now)</li>
  <li>API call only once and distributed it via different components (i would have used redux to make store  and get state globally rather than passing them through components and redux-thunk to make async calls)</li>
  <li>CTA's, text-color, bg-color , bg_image are rendered conditionally from api response</li>
  <li>image card rendered conditionally from api call </li>
  </ul>
